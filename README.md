# Unified Fundus Eye Dataset for AI Retinal Analysis
A curated and unified collection of color fundus images from multiple open-access datasets, designed for training and evaluation of AI models for retinal disease detection.

## Overview
This dataset unifies several publicly available collections of fundus photographs to provide a larger and more diverse set of retinal images.  
It is intended for academic and non-commercial use in computer vision research, particularly for:
- Retinal disease classification
- Transfer learning and model evaluation
- Explainable AI and Grad-CAM visualization studies

## Dataset Composition
